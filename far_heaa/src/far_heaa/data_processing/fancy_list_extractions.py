class FancyListExtractions:
    """
    A utility class that provides extractions and manipulations for lists, including rolling slice assignments
    and finding indices of a subset within a main list.

        Assigns values from `new_values` to the list `lst` starting from the `start` index and rolls over
        if the end of the list is reached.

        Args:
                lst (list): The original list to modify.
                start (int): The starting index where the new values will be inserted.
                new_values (list): The list of new values to assign.

        Returns:
                list: The modified list with the new values assigned.

        Example:
                lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
