<h1> A Fast and Robust Method for  Predicting the Phase Stability of High Entropy Alloys using Pairwise Mixing Enthalpy</h1>


<br>
<br>

This package helps to calculate the mixing enthalpy for high entropy alloys, create phase diagrams using convex hulls to predict stability and then find favourable deposition pathways for synthesis.
