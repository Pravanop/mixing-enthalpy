#Run all jobs in a directory

for i in *;do cd $i; sbatch runjob; cd ..;done #can change * to a specific set of directories too

#Check which jobs have converged in a directory

#re-run jobs that have not converged in a directory

for i in *;do cd $i; cp CONTCAR POSCAR; sbatch runjob; cd ..; done

#Once relaxation is done, run static step

for i in *; do cd $i; cp CONTCAR static/POSCAR; cd static; sbatch runjob; cd ..; cd ..; done

#once everything is done, take the final OUTCAR into a post-processing step

General Tips:
- The fastest way to do high-throughput calculations with a good manual hold is to run all the jobs first.
- Then check which jobs have converged.
- Move the converged jobs to another folder for later processing (call this folder relaxed, call the previous folder
unrelaxed)
- Then re-run whatever needs to be rerun. You should check if the reason is because EDIFF is too high, and cp CONTCAR
POSCAR is the solution.
- in the relaxed folder, run all the static calculations, and you can collect everything for post-processing.
- Do this in batches, and things should move smoothly.

- A general folder structure should be:

- Project_name
    |_ Sub-project1_name
        |_ relaxed (initially empty)
        |_ unrelaxed (contains all vaspruns)
    |_ Sub-project2_name
        |_ ....
